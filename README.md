# Testing Strategies
This repository contains code from my talk _Stategies for testing complex (or legacy) code_ at [LonghornPHP 2021](https://www.longhornphp.com/).

The `main` branch contains the untested code. The branches prefixed with `test_`, contain code for adding tests to the respective code. Changes are made in atomic commits to make it easier to follow along. Even if you were not in attendance.
